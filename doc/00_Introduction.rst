This is the SciKit-Surgery Tutorial on Software Development for Clinical Translation. 
SciKit-Surgery aims to support users in
developing software applications for surgery and medical image computing. 
The aim of this tutorial is to
introduce the user to key concepts in software engineering, enabling the user
to write and publish robust, documented and tested implementations of their 
algorithms. The skills learnt will help the user disseminate their research and
translate their research to clinical applications. 

After the completing the tutorial the user should be able to;

- Use the SciKit-Surgery Python Template to create, test, and publish an implementation of a simple
  image processing algorithm.
- Use GitHub to create and manage a software repository.
- Use tox and GitHub to test the software and create continuous integration tests.
- Create documentation for the software using docstrings and sphinx.
- Publish the documentation to readthedocs
- Publish the software to PyPi.
