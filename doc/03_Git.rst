Getting Started with git
===============================================

Git is a widely used and high quality version control system. It is
designed for multi-developer software projects. 

Step 1: Make a new branch to start working on. Prefix it with the number 1 so we know
it's linked to issue 1.
::
   git checkout -b "1-get-working"

Why use branches, it helps keep things tidy, and enables 
multiple developer to work simultaneously (put a link in here).
You can now start modifying files.
