Getting Started with git
===============================================

WEISSLab uses `git`_ to control and maintain the source code versioning of
projects made using the Python Template. This tutorial is no 
substitute for a good understanding of version control in general and 
`git`_ in particular. We will cover just enough git commands here to get you 
up and running. 

Step 1: Make a new branch to start working on. Prefix it with the number 1 so we know
it's linked to issue 1.
::
   git checkout -b "1-get-working"

You can now start modifying files.
