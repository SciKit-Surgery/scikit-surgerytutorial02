===============================================
Modifying tox.ini to fix test failure
===============================================

The file tox.ini defines what versions of python and what operating systems your code should be
tested with. At the top of the tox.ini file you'll see
::

   # content of: tox.ini , put in same dir as setup.py
   [tox]
   envlist = py27, py36,lint
   skipsdist = True

So by default tox is going to try and run tests on Python 2.7 and Python 3.6. This worked fine
until we added the dependency on vtk, however when you add a dependency to your library, tox needs to
be able to find the appropriate Python modules on the python on the python package index. If we 
have a look at the entry for `vtk`_ we see that there is no version for Python 2.7 and Windows. 
At this point you need to make a decision, do you want your library to support Python 2.7 on Windows 
or do you want to be able to load and process vtk polydata? Lets assume the latter in which case you 
just need to edit tox.ini to remove py27.
