Conclusion 
===============================================

That is all. Congratulations. 
You have:

- Used GitHub to create and manage a software repository.
- Used tox and GitHub to test the software and create continuous integration tests.
- Created documentation for the software using docstrings and sphinx.
- Published the documentation to readthedocs
- Published the software to PyPi.

Your library is well tested, well documented and easily available to other researchers. Should you 
decide to turn your algorithm into a medical device, you also have the beginnings of a quality file, with details 
of what the algorithm should do, tests to validate it, and a documented revision history.
